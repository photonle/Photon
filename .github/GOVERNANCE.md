# Photon Lighting Governance

As a community grows, it's important to know who's doing what, and who's responsible for making decisions.

## Core Development Team

The CDT are those who have been recognised, either for their promotion of Photon (library components, vehicles, etc) or contributing developments to Photon itself.
These users have commit access to the various repositories and may have other elevated permissions if required.
These users have final responsibility for decisions made about Photon.

## Development

These users may are recognised for their skills, again for the promotion or development of Photon, and may have commit access to repos.
